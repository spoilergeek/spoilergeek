                    <h2>Episode #6.1: “Fallout”</h2>
                    <p><strong>Written By:</strong> Marc Guggenheim &amp; Wendy Mericle<br>
                    <strong>Directed By:</strong> James Bamford<br>
                    <strong>Guest Stars:</strong> Manu Bennett (Slade Wilson), Jack Moore (William)<br>
                    <strong>Air Date:</strong> Thursday, October 12, 2017</p>
                    <p><strong>NEW!</strong> <a href="http://www.greenarrowtv.com/arrow-season-6-premiere-photos-fallout/">Some official photos from the <em>Arrow</em> season premiere are here!</a></p>
                    <p><strong>The CW’s Official Description:</strong> <em>THE AFTERMATH&nbsp;—&nbsp;Oliver (Stephen Amell) deals with the fallout of the explosion on the island. James Bamford directed the episode written by Marc Guggenheim &amp; Wendy Mericle (#601).&nbsp; Original airdate 10/12/2017.</em></p>
                    <p>– Realistically, it looks like Samantha Clayton might be the only one to NOT make it off the island alive. RIP Babymama.<br>
                    – William appears in this episode and shares a scene with Oliver where he blames him for what happened. Stephen’s first day of shooting Season 6 was doing scenes with William.<br>
                    – Five months will have passed since Season 5, just like real time. There will be flashbacks to what happened just before and after the end of the <em>Arrow</em> Season 5 finale “Lian Yu.”<br>
                    – At some point, Slade tells Oliver “we walk in two worlds. We can only do that for so long.”<br>
                    – Black Siren obviously lives. “We wouldn’t bring her back just to kill her again,” Marc Guggenheim told a fan.<br>
                    – The new Oliver Queen voiceover is so spoilery that Stephen Amell could not do it at a recent convention.</p>

                    <p>– Raisa the Maid (Kathleen Gati) is returning in Season 6. She has not appeared on<em> Arrow</em> since the first season.<br>
                    – Hope for Olicity? Marc Guggenheim has said those two were set on a “specific trajectory” at the end of Season 5, which sounds positive for fans of the pairing.<br>
                    – There are multiple “Big Bads” this year, and one of them will be played by <em>Person of Interest’</em>s Michael Emerson. We have no idea who he will be playing.<br>

                    – At a convention in Portland, Stephen Amell revealed “two truths and a lie” about Season 6. One was that there is a single Big Bad this year; two is that there will be a giant rift between Oliver and one of the original team members.
